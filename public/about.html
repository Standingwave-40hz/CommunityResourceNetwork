    <h2>About CommShare</h2>
    <p><strong>CommShare</strong> is a community resource sharing platform designed to support local exchange of tools, food, crafts, and services. Whether you're a gardener with extra produce, a craftsperson with surplus materials, or a neighbor in need of a tool for the weekend, CommShare helps bring people together to share what they have.</p>

    <p>The platform allows users to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Post listings for items available to share or trade</li>
      <li>Browse and search local listings by category or keyword</li>
      <li>Manage their own tool and item listings</li>
      <li>Track borrow/return history for community accountability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>About the Creator</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Caley Kelly, the developer behind CommShare. I'm currently studying Computer Programming at Algonquin College. My goal is to build tools that empower local communities to share resources, reduce waste, and build resilience. I have a background in trades, music, and sustainable living â€” and I'm passionate about using technology for good.</p>
